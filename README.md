# SlimTrade
An overlay for Path of Exile that creates macro popups for trade messages. Can also scan for custom phrases, track trade history, ignore items, set color themes, and more!<br>

## Setup
- Ensure you have Java : https://www.java.com/<br>
- Download and run 'SlimTrade.jar' : https://github.com/zmilla93/SlimTrade/releases/latest<br>

## Incoming & Outgoing Trades
Popups are automatically created when trade messages are sent or received.<br>
Incoming trades are green, outgoing trades are red.<br>

There is also a colorblind option to swap green and red for blue and pink respectively. This works independently of the color theme system shown elsewhere.<br>

Incoming trades will turn the buyer's name green and create an info window above the stash with the item and stash name. This info popup can be hovered to highlight the item, or clicked to search the name in the stash. Color coding can be added in the options.<br>
